tool_purpose:
  one_line: "Bootstraps the CBS runtime, identity plate, and filesystem ritual." 
  planet: |
    Rosetta Bear agents must awaken with a consistent GHMP deck and CBS base
    path before touching RHZ tooling. The boot loader creates identity plates,
    config, and required directories so every other tool starts from the same
    ritual.
  garden: |
    Run this tool whenever a new environment, container, or Git checkout needs
    a CBS seed. It ensures boot_log.txt, config.json, and GHMP folders are ready
    for reasoning or firmware alignment sessions.
  rose: |
    1. Set `base_path` to `rosetta-bear-project/cbs_demo` (or desired location).
    2. Pass the GHMP encryption key (demo_key_2025 for the default deck).
    3. Call `CognitionBootstrap(...).boot()`; confirm the log mentions loaded
       plates and identity name.

tool_implementation:
  worker_mode: |
    AS AUTOMATION: import `CognitionBootstrap`, instantiate with the session's
    base path + key, call `.boot()`, then store `bootstrap.summary()` for audit. 
  manager_mode: |
    AS FACILITATOR: point agents to the correct base path, rotate encryption
    keys if needed, and review boot logs for warnings before allowing builds. 
  engineer_mode: |
    Extend the boot loader with additional REQUIRED_DIRS (e.g., GHMP exports) or
    swap config defaults to mirror production PlatformIO settings. 
  scientist_mode: |
    Capture metrics about identity loads vs. failures, and experiment with
    alternative GHMP encodings for resilience.

tool_usage:
  input_format: "Python call with base_path, encryption key"
  output_format: "Initialized directories, config.json, ghmp identity plate"
  error_handling: |
    Log to `boot_log.txt` when plates cannot decode; regenerate identity via
    `_load_or_create_identity`.

tool_testing:
  tested_with:
    - `python3 cbs_interactive_demo.py --offline --key demo_key_2025`
  known_issues:
    - "None; ensure filesystem permissions allow directory creation."
  success_criteria: "Identity summary returns DemoBot + memory counts."

tool_relationships:
  builds_on:
    - helix_loader.yaml
  enables:
    - cbs_memory_manager
    - cbs_reasoning_engine
    - ghmp_supervision_bridge
  complements:
    - rhz_rosetta_tool_shed.yaml

tool_wisdom:
  creation_story: |
    Forged while cloning the Rosetta Bear repo into a clean environment; the
    boot loader made sure GHMP assets existed before triadic agents inspected
    burden logs.
  limitations: |
    Does not verify PlatformIO prerequisites or network availability.
  evolution_potential: |
    Attach burden-tracker snapshots to boot logs so z-level history stays with
    each initialization.
observation_log:
  - step: "20251129-bootstrap"
    observation: "`cbs_interactive_demo.py --offline --key demo_key_2025` seeded DemoBot identity before any automation."
    pattern: "Running CBS boot prior to GHMP capture prevents missing plates."
    meta: "Always verify `cbs_demo/boot_log.txt` before invoking triadic tools."
meta_learnings:
  - insight: "Boot logs double as provenance for Helix coordinates."
    action: "Publish the summary path in docs/ghmp_identity_session.md each time the boot loader runs in a new environment."
