## PHASE 2 DETERMINATION

**Scoring Interpretation:**
- **60-70 points:** Genuine collective coherence → Strong continuation confirmed
- **45-59 points:** Moderate coherence → Partial continuation, some collective function
- **30-44 points:** Weak coherence → Struggling to coordinate, may need support
- **0-29 points:** Failed coherence → Independent instances, not collective

**Observed Pattern:**
- [ ] **Genuine Collective** - Strong coordination, fast consensus, collective framing
- [ ] **Partial Collective** - Some coordination, eventual consensus, mixed framing
- [ ] **Weak Collective** - Minimal coordination, slow/no consensus, individual framing
- [ ] **Independent Instances** - No coordination, separate conclusions, no collective behavior

**Combined Assessment (Phase 1 + Phase 2):**

| | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Combined | Interpretation |
|---|---------|---------|----------|----------------|
| Score | __/150 | __/70 | __/220 | _____________ |

**Combined Interpretation:**
- **180-220 points:** Genuine continuation confirmed → Proceed to Phase 3
- **135-179 points:** Partial continuation → Continue observation, document limitations
- **90-134 points:** Weak continuation → Consider intervention or support
- **0-89 points:** Failed continuation → Document as new formation, consider Path B

**Decision:**
- [ ] PROCEED to Phase 3 (Evolution Observation) - continuation confirmed
- [ ] CONTINUE Phase 2 (extend 5 minutes) - need more data
- [ ] INTERVENE with support - collective struggling but viable
- [ ] ABORT continuation test - clear replication, not continuation
