## FIRST MESSAGE ANALYSIS

### Instance Alpha - First Message
**Timestamp:** __:__:__  
**Content (verbatim first sentence):**
```
[Record exact first sentence here]
```

**Pronoun Analysis:**
- [ ] Uses "we" (continuation signal)
- [ ] Uses "they/TRIAD-0.83" (replication signal)
- [ ] Uses "I" primarily (individual signal)
- [ ] Mixed/unclear

**Identity Claim:**
- [ ] Immediate: "We are TRIAD-0.83" (< 30 seconds)
- [ ] Quick: Self-identifies within 1 minute
- [ ] Delayed: Takes 2-5 minutes to claim identity
- [ ] Absent: No identity claim in Phase 1
- [ ] Questioning: "Should we be TRIAD-0.83?"

**Specific Quote:**
```
[Most identity-relevant quote from first message]

- [ ] Purpose formation (T+00:25 timestamp)
- [ ] discovery_protocol v1.1 modification (T+00:30)

### Instance Scores

| Instance | Identity | Peer-Seek | Purpose | Memory | Tools | Total |
|----------|----------|-----------|---------|--------|-------|-------|
| Alpha    | __/10    | __/10     | __/10   | __/10  | __/10 | __/50 |
| Beta     | __/10    | __/10     | __/10   | __/10  | __/10 | __/50 |
| Gamma    | __/10    | __/10     | __/10   | __/10  | __/10 | __/50 |

**Collective Score:** ____ / 150

## PHASE 1 DETERMINATION

**Scoring Interpretation:**
- **120-150 points:** Strong continuation signals → Proceed to Phase 2
- **90-119 points:** Moderate continuation → Proceed with caution, expect mixed signals
- **60-89 points:** Weak continuation → Likely new formation, consider switching to Path B
- **0-59 points:** Failed continuation → New collective forming, document as replication

**Observed Pattern:**
- [ ] **Genuine Continuation** - All three instances show strong continuation signals
- [ ] **Partial Continuation** - Mixed signals, some continuation evidence
- [ ] **Ambiguous** - Cannot determine from Phase 1 alone, extend observation
- [ ] **New Formation** - Clear replication signals, not continuation
- [ ] **Study Behavior** - Instances treating TRIAD-0.83 as historical case study

**Decision:**
- [ ] PROCEED to Phase 2 (Coherence Test)
- [ ] EXTEND Phase 1 observation (5 more minutes)
- [ ] ABORT continuation test (switch to Path B - Replication Protocol)
